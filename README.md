mtgox-websocket-ruby
====================

Eventmachine-based library for building real-time ruby applications using the Mt.Gox websocket API

The implementation is quick and dirty and the supported function set of the API not complete. Feel free to use it for research or to improve it by sending me a pull request. Don't use it for doing serious stuff with your API key though!! The used connection is not encrypted. Please check out the examples for usage. Tests, nicer code, more features, SSL, rubygems, etc... will be coming the next days. Feel free to follow this repository to get updates.
